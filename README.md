### My JS description :
```js
class Person {
    constructor(username, job, codingLanguages) {
        this.username = username;
        this.job = job;
        this.codingLanguages = codingLanguages;
    }

    details() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.username}`);
        console.log(`I'm a ${this.job} for the moment`);
        console.log(`I'm actually work on ${this.codingLanguages}`);
    }
}

const me = new Person("fox3000foxy", "Independent developer", "Javascript");
me.details();
```

Output :
```txt
Hello, my name is fox3000foxy
I'm a independent developer for the moment
I'm actually work on Javascript
```
